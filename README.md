=================

This is a mobile friendly web application which shows Earthquake activities from around the world on a timeline. The application queries for earthquake information from USGS databse.

The application has two major parts:

1. The 2D timeline view

2. The 3D cross-section view

The user has options to speed up, speed down, play and pause the time, show/hide the plate boundaries and select different date ranges and magnitude cutoffs. Selecting different date ranges and magnitude cutoffs can be done by using the UI or by giving parameters in the URL. The date selector calculates the magnitude range to accomodate optimum number of earthquake events.
